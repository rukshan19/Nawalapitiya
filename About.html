           <p class="par">
           Nawalapitiya is a town in Kandy District, Sri Lanka. It is governed by an Urban Council.<br>
             It is 38 km (24 mi) away from Kandy and 112 km from Colombo, at a height of 589 m (1,932 ft) above sea level. <br>
             It is located on the banks of the Mahaweli Ganga. The area was developed during the colonisation of the island by the British,<br>
              as one of the colony's centres of Coffee Production.<br><br>


            In 1874 the railway line was extended from Kandy to Nawalapitiya, with the Nawalapitiya railway station opening on 21 December.<br>
            The station serves as a terminus for a number of commuter trains, with all local trains stopping at the station.<br>
            The station comprises three platforms and two siding loops.
            In 1885 the railway was extended to Nanu Oya.
